Fourteen beers at chili's.

You are a very thirsty battle hardened man. You wish to drink 14 beers at chili's, but the way to chili's is perilous.
Sitting at your tv, you can't control yourself anymore. You need these 14 beers.

You:
(1) Get up (Start the game)
(2) Give up (Game over)
(3) Fart (Nothing happens)

  You open your door and walk down the street. Suddenly, you're hit with the realisation that you didn't bring your map.
  "Ehh, I'll find my way." you proclaim. To your left you see an alley with 2 shady men. To your right is a construction site.
  (1) Go left
  (2) Go right

You go left. The shady men approach you. They appear to be ninjas. "Never should have come here". They both wield katanas. You have 20 euros.
(1) Fight back (50% success)
(2) Give them your money (Money - 20)
(3) Dance-off

You are above the alley.
In the distance you spot chili's in all its glory. This fills you with determination.
You need to get down. You see a difficult way down, and a balcony with an open door.
(1) Agility (20% success)
(2) Jump
(3) Enter the door

You get down from the rooftop, and are in front of Chili's. The leader of the ninjas awaits you.
"I'm impressed you have gotten this far. But your journey ends here! Fight me, I dare you!"
(1) Give up
(2) Fight (10%)
(3) Reason

(1) "You can't do this! I only want 14 beers at chili's! (Plead)
(2) "You won't get away with this!" (Threaten)
(3) "I shall offer you my services when I have gotten my 14 beers!" (Offer services)

You go right. You examine the construction site, and come to the conclusion that there's 3 ways through. A worker offers you passage
in exchange for a fair offer. You have 20 euros.
(1) Offer money
(2) Parkour up (40% success)
(3) Threaten the workers

You get through the construction site. You find a poster advertisement for chili's. Just 1 euro for a beer!
Next to the poster are directions to get to chili's. The directions it gives lead through a dangerous part of town. You decide to:
(1) Go through town
(2) Go through the sewers
(3) Flip

You decide to go through the town.
You encounter 5 ninjas! They aren't armed, but they're dangerous. You:
(1) Masterfully defeat the ninjas (50% success)
(2) Flee
(3) Dance-off

You get past the ninjas. A stranger offers you a cookie for 10 euros.
(1) Yes please!
(2) No.

You arrive at the front of chilis to find it enclosed. There's been a stabbing, but that won't stop you from getting your 14 beers.
A cop stops you. You:
(1) Explain the situation
(2) Fight
(3) Dance-off

"I'll let you through, you remind me of myself."
You enter chili's. Finally, you can get your 14 beers. You order 14 beers, but he explains he needs the money first.
(If money >= 14) GOOD END
(If money <14) BAD END

You decide to enter the sewers.
In the sewers you find a giant rat with a crown. He seems to be holding a key of some sort.
(1) Seize the crown (40%)
(2) Back off
